# Style Guide

This is a work-in-progress guide to writing and formatting content for LaunchCode education programs.

## Headings

For headings, use sentence case (all major words of the headline capitalized). For the definition of "major word" we defer to AP style:

> Capitalize the first word of every letter except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of three letters or fewer. Thereâ€™s one exception: Any word that is the first word in the headline or the last word should be capitalized, regardless of its part of speech.

## Application and UI Labels

Format labels for application menus and other UI components using italics.

<aside class="aside-example">

To open a file in Atom, use *File > Open*.

</aside>

## Code Segments

<aside class="aside-note">

The following section uses Markdown syntax. The same principles apply for RST, but with the corresponding syntax. See the RST section below for info on how you should format code segments in RST.

</aside>

### Fenced code blocks

For code segments more than two or three words long, or for those that warrant calling the user's attention to, use triple-backtics (`` ` ``) or triple-tildes (`~`) to create a fenced code block. Add the language in question just after the opening triple to enable syntax higlighting.

~~~md
```java
public static int counter;
```
~~~

<aside class="aside-note">

We prefer backtics over tildes; however, tildes should be used when it is necessary to include triple-backtics within the block itself.

</aside>

Some common language identifiers supported by Pygments are: `java`, `python`, `csharp`, `html`, `css`, `js`, and `sql`. A [full list of supported languages](http://pygments.org/languages/) is available. To find the language identifier for a supported language, refer to the "Short name" property of the language's lexer from the [full list of Pygments lexers](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).

For terminal/shell commands, no language identifier is used:

~~~md
```
$ javac Hello.java
```
~~~

Shell commands displayed in block style should include a generic prompt: `\$`. Shell commands displayed inline (as below) should _not_ be prepended with `\$`.

### Inline code

For short segments, or individual code words, enclose in single backtics:

~~~md
The `static` keyword in Java is used to...
~~~

You should always enclose the following types of types of items in single backtics:

- Programming language keywords, symbols, and identifiers
- File and directory names
- URLs referenced literally (i.e. not linked)

For inline code that contains a backtic, use double backtics:

~~~md
There is a literal backtic here: ``(`)``
~~~

<aside class="aside-note">

One exception to this rule is when any of these elements appears in a heading. See the [Headings](#headings) section for details.

## Linking

When adding a link to a page, create a **semantic link** if at all possible. A semantic link is one in which the text content of the link describes the destination URL. In particular, links with text content that is the destination URL itself should be *avoided at all costs!*

Here is a semantic link:

<aside class="aside-example">

Read about <a href="https://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/java4python/data-types/">data types in Java</a>.

</aside>

Here is a non-semantic link:

<aside class="aside-example">

Read about data types in Java <a href="https://education.launchcode.org/skills-back-end-java/java4python/data-types/">here</a>.

</aside>

And this is about the worst thing you can do:

<aside class="aside-">

## RST Conventions

- For headings, the hierarchy of characters underlining text should be: `=` (level-1 headings), `-` (level-2 headings), `^` (level-3 headings).
- `.. sourcecode::` and `.. code-block::` are synonymous directives for creating fenced code blocks, but we prefer `.. sourcecode::`.
- When using `::` to format unhighlighted literal blocks, place the `::` on their own line.
- Use double backtics to surround inline code segments: ` ``x`` `.
- For ordered lists, use `#.` over numeric item lables like `1.`
- Use `.. figure::` over `.. image::` since the former has a richer set of options.

## Language Conventions

- Use the Oxford comma!
- Use a single space after end-of-sentence punctuation! 
- Use "JavaScript" over the abbrevition "JS"
- Hyphenate compound adjectives, such as "left-hand side"
- Prefer "cannot" over "can not"
